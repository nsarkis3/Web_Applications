				<h1>Explanation</h1>
				<div class="col-sm-4" id="Landing">
					<h3>Landing Page</h3>
					<p>The way that this program works is by using html as the base for the website, a combination of css and bootstrap to make it look appealing, and ajax for functionality. The program first has a Landing Page (this one) to welcome the user to the website, from there I created a nav bar to guide the user throughout the website. The user can go to two other pages, a weather page, and a history page.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3" id="Weather">
					<h3>Weather Page</h3>
					<p>The weather page prompts the user for a location in the search bar and provides an example. Once the user presses search, the program uses a fuzzy search in order to return latitude and longitude coordinates. This call to the fuzzy search api is handeled using ajax. From there the program takes those coordinates and uses the openweathermap api to return a five day forcast in a JSON array. The ajax then takes this information, deciphers it, and puts that information in the correct spot, updating the page in the process. If the user would like to, they can search a new location and see the weather there.</p> 
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4" id="History">
					<h3>History Page</h3>
					<p>The last page is a history page, this will show any of the past searches utilizing the php rest server for storage. Information is stored as an object as well as fuzzy search paremeters. All information is stored in a database on the rest server and there is a getter methods to call back that data. Finish this.</p>
